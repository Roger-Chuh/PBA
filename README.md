# Photometric Bundle Adjustment
This repository tries to implement the paper Photometric Bundle Adjustment for Dense Multi-View 3D Modeling.

## Tasks
- [x] Get the SFM to work OpenMVG used
- [x] Get the Meshing to work OpenMVS used
- [x] Generate visibility function
- [ ] Texture estimation(repo not updated)
- [x] Energy function calculation
- [x] Gradient calculation over X
- [ ] Reflect changes in vertex over PLY file
- [ ] Gradient calculation over camera parameters
- [ ] Gradient calculation over textures
- [ ] Compilation of everything to a single pipeline
- [ ] Try it on other dataset
